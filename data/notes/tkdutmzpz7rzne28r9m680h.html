<p>Dendron uses Antd for its component styling.</p>
<p>In order to create a custom style, we gotta override the theme. Antd's v5 release drops .less support in favor of tokens, but Dendron wants a css file. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emeks/antd-custom-theme-generator">You can use this npm package</a> to generate an antd-friendly css file.</p>
