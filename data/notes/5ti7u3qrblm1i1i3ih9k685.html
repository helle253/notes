<p>It’s my shift and I cannot sleep<br>
my daughter rests peacefully beside me,<br>
covered by a warm flannel shirt,<br>
moments ago wrapped round us both,<br>
the rest of the world must wait  </p>
<p>We take turns<br>
At 7, mom puts her to bed.<br>
Then to 4AM its my duty to wake with her,<br>
and soothe her back to sleep<br>
usually, I get an hour or two of rest between!<br>
Usually. Not tonight, but usually.  </p>
<p>well before dawn she’ll be hungry<br>
my tools’re smote to ash in my hands<br>
in comes the cavalry (mom) for breakfast,<br>
while I rest for a few uninterrupted hours,<br>
in the other room.  </p>
<p>then, breakfast,<br>
then, work,<br>
then, bathtime,<br>
there and back again.  </p>
<p>P.S. I did the dishes while insomnia did me in.</p>
