<p>A little proof of concept app I whipped up as a PoC for a friend.</p>
<p>It took a little bit of wrangling, because the plugin I was hoping to rely on didn't actually provide the data I needed (vertices) in order to render the user's face as a mesh and share that via the native share sheet widget.</p>
<p>Was fun! I try to avoid working with Swift/Objective C because I'm not a fan of XCode. (I like Flutter better, but I'm not entirely confident support for it won't be axed at any given second. RIP Google Domains...)</p>
