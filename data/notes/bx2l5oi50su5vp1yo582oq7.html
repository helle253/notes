<h1 id="a-journey">A Journey<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#a-journey"></a></h1>
<p>two men, a muslim and a jew, set out on foot<br>
from neighbouring towns, on a pilgrimage to jerusalem<br>
they meet upon the road, and agree to share in the journey.  </p>
<p>when the Khamsin blows, they choke the same dust<br>
when a spring is found, they drink the same waters<br>
in the evening twilight, they break their bread<br>
and share stories of their youth over firelight.  </p>
<p>they arrive in jerusalem, and go their separate ways<br>
the muslim meets another one of his people<br>
this other also comes to the holy city on pilgrimage<br>
held aloft on a palanquin, floating over the road<br>
his feet never touched the road.  </p>
<p>who is the compatriot of the one who originally set out on the road?</p>
