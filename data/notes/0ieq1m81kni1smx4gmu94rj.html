<p>Hey, my name is Nathan.</p>
<p>I'm a programmer a Blue Bottle Coffee.</p>
<p>My day job involves a lot of Typescript and Ruby. I bang on the frontend, the backend, and everything in between. Owing to this, I've had a lot of exposure to just about every part of our stack - from Tailwind &#x26; UI components to our <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blue-bottle-coffee/id1440573734">mobile app</a> to CDK and provisioning/managing AWS resources. To be honest, I wouldn't have it any other way. I love learning - having my fingers in every part of the software pie (frontend, backend, devops, [...]) ensures I've always got something new consider.</p>
<p>This website is markdown and I use <a href="https://www.dendron.so/">Dendron</a> to take notes. Not much here (yet) but hopefully that will change. You can look at the source <a href="https://github.com/helle253/notes">here</a>.</p>
