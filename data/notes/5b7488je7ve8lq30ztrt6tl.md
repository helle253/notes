## Falkland Islands War

I'm going to limit this to a partial list of British Entities, for simplicity's sake.

### Places

(are these administrative_areas, or are they states? They're overseas territories, so technically not state/province level.)

How is 'ownership' represented in schema.org? It seems like it kind of doesn't exist.

[Operation Black Buck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Black_Buck) - [Schema](https://schema.org/EventSeries)

Operation Black Buck is actually a series of 7 operations, so it's not a single event. This seems like an interesting schema model to consider.
