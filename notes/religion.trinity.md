Kinda funny that the creation of the trinity can be read as a sort of of combination/overcoming of monism (neoplatonism) and dualism (zoroastrianism)

It's a little on the nose to go 1 + 2 = 3, but also... sometimes a spade is a spade. You can't exactly separate Christian symbology from its earlier constituent parts easily.
