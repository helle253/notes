two men, a muslim and a jew, set out on foot
from neighbouring towns, on a pilgrimage to jerusalem
they meet upon the road, and agree to share in the journey.

when the Khamsin blows, they choke the same dust
when a spring is found, they drink the same waters
in the evening twilight, they break their bread
and share stories of their youth over firelight.

they arrive in jerusalem, and go their separate ways
the muslim meets another one of his people
this other also comes to the holy city on pilgrimage
held aloft on a palanquin, floating over the road
his feet never touched the road.

who is the compatriot of the one who originally set out on the road?
