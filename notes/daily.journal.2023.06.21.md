# Daily note

Gonna try daily note taking again, at least insofar as I have thoughts on stuff. Maybe it'll be helpful.

I need to get back and finish the 'First Fossils of the Americans' - it's a really good read. Puts into context the more fantastic elements of the Mormon mythos. Joseph Smith doesn't seem so loony, when everyone was convinced dinosaurs were just around the corner, if only they could climb the hill.
