lol [[books.a-peoples-tragedy-the-russian-revolution]] is absurdly relevant.

If this coup attempt is successful (which its imo unlikely to be, in the long term, but it may be enough to destabilize the Kremlin such that a real opposition can collect and mount a political offensive) I don't know who is winning?

Prigozhin is signalling mostly that he is doing this on behalf of the Russian soldiers ? Which is obviously false but it gives a similar form to the populist affects of russian revolutionaries over a century earlier. He's making empty appeals to populist sentiments which may very well play nice against the openly oligarchal Kremlin.

It hinges on what the common Russian soldier feels, not the chattering classes abroad and on twitter. I bet they're pretty bitter about this war, but like WWI, this coup attempt does not seem to preclude a continuation of the invasion. Seems shortsighted, but who knows.

'Most of the land returned to the gentry was rented back to the peasentry, usually at a fixed rate of 1/3 of the harvest'

The whites were seeking to restore the local apparatus of the old regime - the district captains were virtually identical to the tsarist land captains (in some cases, the appointed district captain and the old tsarist land captain were the SAME PERSON). The whites, in effect, were trying to return to an old system, without incorporating the change in spirit and culture caused by the peasant revolution.
