Hey, my name is Nathan.

I'm a programmer a Blue Bottle Coffee.

My day job involves a lot of Typescript and Ruby. I bang on the frontend, the backend, and everything in between. Owing to this, I've had a lot of exposure to just about every part of our stack - from Tailwind & UI components to Flutter to CDK and AWS provisioning. To be honest, I wouldn't have it any other way. I love learning, and having my fingers in every part of the software pie (frontend, backend, devops, ...) ensures I've always got something new to puzzle on.

Oh, I'm also responsible for our [mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blue-bottle-coffee/id1440573734).

This website is markdown and I use [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) to take notes. You can look at the source [here](https://github.com/helle253/notes)
