Hey, my name is Nathan.

I'm a programmer a Blue Bottle Coffee.

My day job involves a lot of Typescript and Ruby. I'm usually either extending our frontend or plumbing the depths of our AWS.

Oh, I'm also responsible for our [mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blue-bottle-coffee/id1440573734).


This website is markdown and I use [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) to take notes. You can look at the source [here](https://github.com/helle253/notes)
