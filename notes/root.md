Hey, my name is Nathan.

I'm a programmer a Blue Bottle Coffee.

My day job involves a lot of Typescript and Ruby. I bang on the frontend, the backend, and everything in between. Owing to this, I've had a lot of exposure to just about every part of our stack - from Tailwind & UI components to our [mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blue-bottle-coffee/id1440573734) to CDK and provisioning/managing AWS resources. To be honest, I wouldn't have it any other way. I love learning - having my fingers in every part of the software pie (frontend, backend, devops, [...]) ensures I've always got something new consider.

This website is markdown and I use [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) to take notes. Not much here (yet) but hopefully that will change. You can look at the source [here](https://github.com/helle253/notes).
