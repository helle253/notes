Hey, my name is Nathan.

I'm a programmer at Blue Bottle Coffee.

My day job involves a lot of Typescript and Ruby, and I'm responsible for our [mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blue-bottle-coffee/id1440573734).


This website is markdown and I use [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) to take notes.
