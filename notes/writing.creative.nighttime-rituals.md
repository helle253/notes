### 2:30 AM, Dec. 14 2022
It’s my shift and I cannot sleep  
my daughter rests peacefully beside me,  
covered by a warm flannel shirt,  
moments ago wrapped round us both,  
the rest of the world must wait  
  
We take turns  
At 7, mom puts her to bed.  
Then to 4AM its my duty to wake with her,  
and soothe her back to sleep  
usually, I get an hour or two of rest between!  
Usually. Not tonight, but usually.  
  
well before dawn she’ll be hungry  
my tools’re smote to ash in my hands  
in comes the cavalry (mom) for breakfast,  
while I rest for a few uninterrupted hours,  
in the other room.  
  
then, breakfast,  
then, work,  
then, bathtime,  
there and back again.  
  
P.S. I did the dishes while insomnia did me in.
