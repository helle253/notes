I think a lot of value is placed on thinking fast, especially in my professional life as a programmer. In the realm of knowledge work more generally, a premium is placed on quick thinking. The industry moves fast, it's your job to move faster and beat your competitors to market. And to be clear, I think that value is real. AI assistants like Cursor and Copilot et al make it even easier to think and move quickly, when it comes to programming.

It might be an effective strategy for getting stuff out the door,but I don't find it to be a compelling tool for learning, which is the most important thing someone can do as a knowledge worker. Most of my learning happens between study/learning sessions not during them. I can spend several hours without success trying to 'get' a subject, only to return several days later and immediately see what I was previously missing.

AI tools do a massive disservice on this front, because there is fundamentally less friction in while working to force users to take a break and return later, allowing that passive synthesis to occur. Maybe this is a cope, maybe not. 

This applies to more than just programming though - I often find myself lost in the sauce trying to understand theory as I'm reading, but later it clicks effortlessly.
