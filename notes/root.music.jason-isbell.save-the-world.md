An actually sympathetic portrayal of the beseiged mindset. 

A spate of people getting shot knocking on the wrong door, or turning into the wrong driveway a month or two ago has had me thinking about this quite a bit. The increasing incidence of mass shootings and other national-news tragedies without any apparent meaning - explicitly politically motivated attacks can be attributed to a 'Cause', nihilistic ones, while often politically motivated in some postmodern sense, don't have the same attributable nature.

Anyways, a few things are meeting a confluence in some abstract sense:

- the increasing incidence of these 'random' acts of violence
- emphasis on self-defense as the pro-2A rationale
- homeschooling/school-choice
- Castle Doctrine

I don't think these are by any means tightly linked, but I don't think they're unlinked either. If I were cynical enough about political motivations, I'd argue that these events benefit the right in undermining public schools as an institution, by stoking fears that these are unsafe places. 'Thoughts and prayers' and no material improvements to the safety of schoolchildren.

Parents are (reasonably!) not rational about the safety of their children. These things undermine one of the very basic premises of public schools - that they are safe environments.


Anyways, I think that fear is reasonable.
