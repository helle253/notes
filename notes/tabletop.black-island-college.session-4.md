This morning, we got a memo from the guy who we left the tablets with

We stopped at the guys house. it stinks. old cat

Checking the bookshelf, important book shows up:
- Small octavo, bound in black vellum
- weird, forbidden book on the shelf
- written in Greek, ~17th c.

the tablets were not what they seemed to be (duh)
