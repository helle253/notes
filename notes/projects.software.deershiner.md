Probably will change this name
for a terrain map of ukraine:
- integrate acars + marine open source data to form a better picture around vehicle movements
- integrate planet labs scans + ability to request new ones to show photographs of key areas
- use gpt vision to describe photographs and mark key objects
- integrate internet radio recordings, particularly around uk and ru unencrypted transmissions, using whisper+gpt to translate foreign voice to english text
- integrate telegram group channels, converting foreign language to text, and surfacing keywords and locations using proper noun recognition

basically by using only internet services you can build a pretty-accurate picture of all vehicle and troop movements on both sides and put it on a constantly updated map, then integrate search and embeddings to be able to search for specific things like "blown up buildings" or "tanks" or "minefields"
