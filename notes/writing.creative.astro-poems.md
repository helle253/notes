Aquarius bears draughts of Heaven’s endless flows. His cup upturneth to lay the earth’s thirst low. Placed among the stars is Phrygia’s handsomest youth, that beloved servant of Jove. By his hand alone courses what is above into its below.

Aries first mantled in Golden fleece, commands the Sun’s descent to cease; In a grove of Mars its pelt was brought, there shines the Dawn Proclaimer, whom Argo sought; the Ram, impatient sacrifice, That Which Knows; which saved Isaac in the Sacred Grove.

Cancer dimly in the skies alights. Its watery chambers saw dawn’s first light. No match for Hercules was this pincered foe, yet in its claws the Sun’s ascent froze. Lunar champion and Hera’s aide, against it’s influence begin solar rays to fade.

Capricorn’s, from depths inspired; By thy domain the Arts are conspired; By thee the Miners burn the Womb of Earth; And see the place of Metal’s fatal birth; By thee they melt; by thee they work the Mould, Refine, and Stamp it into mighty Gold.

Gemini twins atop Heaven mount. And they o’er gates of hell stand guard. They are Castor and Pollux, keepers of St. Elmo’s fire. United in will and with fates entwined, so does their wit reign o’er their Nature and refine.

Leo, rampart of the lion’s whelp — Judah. He who received the praise of his brethren: whose hand was in the neck of his enemies; his father’s children bowed before him. The sceptre did not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh’s arrival; and unto him was the gathering of his people.

Libra’s scales, upon which poize Night and Day; in hand Justice weigh’d her Balance. Only she knoweth what guard the Good; Only she knoweth what the Guilty owe; Only she Judgeth their Fate.

Pisces, doubled in shining scale, from the Underworld ascend; They know the Coasts, the Winds, the Ports, and Shores; may turn the Helm, or ply the bending Oars; As they direct, ne’er lost the Tide, retain mastery o’er the gulfs wide.

Sagittarius, the Archer, mantle of Krotos, son of Eupheme, nurse of the Muses. Behold he hath carried his bow unto the stars. And behold Zeus hath rendered unto him a horse’s flank, for his fleetness of foot. And behold Zeus hath rendered unto him a Satyr’s tail, for his zeal unto the Muses. And behold a wreath at his feet, as befits the Son of Pan.

Scorpio who with slew with poison boastful Orion. “There is no wild beast,” spoke he, “which I cannot master.” Wrothful Gaia sent forth her pincered champion, for justice accrued: the life of Orion’s ward, Artemis was due. Her guardian, Orion, in her defense rose; he against its pincers ne’er found repose; beneath its poison his last breath deposed. For their daring, by Jove’s hand eachs ascends; in eternal rivalry they the astral plains still rend.

Taurus slowmoving laid temple foundations to lastt.With limbs of weighty iron and reserved aspiring minds, it’s oxen shoulders hold heavy burdens steadfast. That Golden calf yet carries forth from heaven’s depths, brighter skies o’er these earthly steppes.

Virgo’s gentle rays do polish hearts, in man’s breast they injustice thwart, With words honey’d smooth, and rhetoric strong, they rule and are e’en monarchs by their tongue. Mother Mary’s paeans heard far above, from her lips modest praise proclaim’d soft.
