## Data Sources

### Acars

#### Airframes

<https://app.airframes.io/messages/live>

It's cool, relies on more than just ads-b. but no stations anywhere near any place of interest

#### Flightradar

### Marine Vessel Location Data

#### [aisstream.io](https://aisstream.io/)

Tracks more than just location data:

- Binary Ship To Ship Messages
- SAR Aircraft Position
- Accident And Danger Reports
- Ship Property and Voyage Data

### Planet Labs

### Internet Radio Recordings

### Telegram Group Channels

### (Unsecured) CCTV cameras

## Ingestion Tools

### GPT Vision

## Mapping/GIS Tools

I have the most familiarity with Mapbox but it is not a significant familiarity. Seems like it might be useful as it provides good mobile interface support?

OTOH ArcGIS has direct PG support, which might be handy to explore.
