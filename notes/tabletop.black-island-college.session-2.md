Session 2 -

Macalester Amalgamated Detective Agency

- Detective Wilkes

Timbuktu has burnt down.

Metal tubes as thick as a soda can, 2-3 feet long. screw top on the top. paper tag with a code on it - mysterious letters and numbers. (architectural plans?)

4 main rooms -

living room, dining room, study, kitchen.

Monmouth cty govt. sealed letter.

Letter about repeated instances of tresspassing on some parcel of land in the boroughs somewhere.

Nautical charts in the tubes. Unclear where they point to, but it says 'Monmouth County yadda yadda yadda'

Curios and artifacts in a display case in the study. (Pit of St. Eustace in South America). Ugly little pygmy demons in obscene little stances w/ Mona Lisa smiles.

Diary on the desk that Huber is sitting down to read.

20 minutes digging through the book. mostly nonsense and interdepartmental feuding and stuff. An address has been underlined a few times - NOTE THE ADDRESS IT IS IN MOORISH HARBOR SOUTH OF SOQOURSET.

5 Basque relief stones wrapped in paper, marked 1 2 4 5 6 (3 is clearly missing)

Moorish Harbor 10 miles south of Soquoroset

Silas: This address we are headed to in Moorish Harbor - down in the 'Grecian' neighborhood. A guy, Christos, from Crete, said they dont speak any Greek he knows. they showed up around 18 months ago. Don't speak english, dont know where they came from. They're more lost in America than they musta been wherever they came from.
