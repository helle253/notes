## [Packmule Boulangerie](https://github.com/helle253/packmule)

A rails app I put together for a buddy of mine. It is not currently live, unfortunately.

The most interesting part was implementing a client-side js rendering tool for taking a `.glb` file and outputting a nice GIF where the scene rotates endlessly. The intention was to be able to upload this and allow the content managers to upload a GIF every week for whatever the new boulangerie box was!

The cursor is missing in this gif, but hovering over one of the cards would pause the rotation!
