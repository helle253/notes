I am collector and sender of postcards and this was a small project undertaken to create a series of 12 postcards, each themed off the traditional zodiac symbols. The intention is to provide a canvas to showcase Dr. John Bevis's stupendous [Uranographia Britannica (ca. 1749)](https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/bevis-uranographia).


To this end, I drafted a series of 12 small poems. You can see in the image above the desired format - it was an interesting challenge to work within the constraints of the form. You can find them [here](projects.astro-cards.poems). I leaned heavily on Marcus Manilius's Astronomica, as translated by Thomas Creech (1659-1700) - as well as referring to a fair amount of anglo poetry from the early modern era. Also, a lot of old assyriologists/egyptologists from the late 19th/early 20th century. I have the full list of references on a hard drive somewhere, I hope to get around to recovering them one day.

Baskerville was an intuitive choice of typeface, being a product of the era I intended to emulate. I'm sure others exist, but Baskerville is popular and readily available for use.
