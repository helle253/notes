## Exercise

6-29-23 - 2mi - 20:20
7-3-23 - 3.5mi - 31:03
7-5-23 - 3.1mi - 30:20
Sideache did me in at the 2mi mark and i had to slow to a walk and stretch it out.
The last 6/10 of a mile was rough - extending my stride helped keep the abdominal area that was cramping stretching a bit, but I was heavily restricting my diaphragm, tightening my core to keep the twinge off - breathing became much harder.

7-19-23 - 3.1mi - 27:24
Did ok, didn't finish the last 1/5mi at the pace i wanted. Shoulda been under 27:00. Oh well, next time.
