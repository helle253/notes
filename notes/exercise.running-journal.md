Sideache did me in at the 2mi mark and i had to slow to a walk and stretch it out.

The last 6/10 of a mile was rough - extending my stride helped keep the abdominal area that was cramping stretching a bit, but I was heavily restricting my diaphragm, tightening my core to keep the twinge off - breathing became much harder.

Did ok, didn't finish the last 1/5mi at the pace i wanted. Shoulda been under 27:00. Oh well, next time.
