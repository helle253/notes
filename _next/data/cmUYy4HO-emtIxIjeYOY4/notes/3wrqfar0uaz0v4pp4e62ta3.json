It is not currently live, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>The most interesting part was implementing a client-side js rendering tool for taking a <code>.glb</code> file and outputting a nice GIF where the scene rotates endlessly. The intention was to be able to upload this and allow the content managers to upload a GIF every week for whatever the new boulangerie box was! You Cacan find the source code <a href=\"https://github.com/helle253/packmule/blob/main/app/javascript/controllers/dashboard_controller.js\">here</a>. I wasn't satisfied with the existing solutions for consuming a scene description and returning a simple .gif. Cloudinary has <a href=\"https://cloudinary.com/documentation/transformations_on_3d_models\">something</a> like what I was looking for, but it did not support the minimum frame rates I was looking for.</p>\n<p>CCapture.js allowed me to preserve a constant frame-rate during the recording process. User inputs the .glb, hits record, and the client-side browser spits something nice back out.</p>\n<p>I wanted to add some primitive controls (view-angle, distance, rotation speed, duration, etc.) but working with Javascript from within Rails is pretty onerous, and the MVP got the job done.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/packmule.gif\" alt=\"Example Viewport\"></p>\n<p>The cursor is missing in this snippet, but hovering over one of the cards would pause the rotation!</p>\n<p>The rest of the app is fully functional, albeit sparing. Users can sign up and sign up for food-boxes. Admins can sign in, manage users, record notes about them (for recording delivery instructions), and upload media (with the intention of showcasing previous boxes).</p>\n<p>It was an enjoyable experience building this, the folks I built it for were and are super collaborative partners. It required iteration and a ton of conversations honing in on what the goals were, and I'm proud of the finished product.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"0ieq1m81kni1smx4gmu94rj","title":"Home","desc":"","updated":1730393792032,"created":1730393636355,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"home","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"notes"},"contentHash":"2e466bdc94e9b477698a14056fac7731","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":[],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nHey, my name is Nathan.\n\nI'm a programmer a Blue Bottle Coffee.\n\nMy day job involves a lot of Typescript and Ruby.
